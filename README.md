#McMaster Masters/PhD Template (Physics/Astronomy)

##Requirements

Working current texlive installation with basic packages, see \usepackage commands in thesis.tex preamble.

##Introduction

A simple, bare-bones thesis template for Masters/PhD degree (Physics/Astronomy) written in LaTeX. Satisfies all requirements in the department of graduate studies (as of July 2014) - but you should double check just in case. You may wish to add custom table or figure packages, and probably change up the \bibliographystyle command to something more field specific.

Change up the bash script as needed, alter anything you want to make it your own. If you're looking for something more complex check out [Gabriel A. Devenyi's wicked thesis template](https://github.com/gdevenyi/mcmaster.latex).

##Installation

`
$ git clone https://github.com/astronomerdamo/mcmaster_thesis_template.git
`

So this doesn't install anything, just copies the latex files and folder to your machine.
